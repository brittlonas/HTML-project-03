  <li style= font-size:30px>Kurilian Bobtail</li>
  <img src="http://www.kurilianbobtails.net/91483603Kurilian_Bobtail.jpg"/>
  <p style= font-size:25px;> This is a natural breed -- it wasn't created by breeders.
    It appeared as a spontaneous mutation -- native to the Kuril Islands, an archipelago located between Japan and Russia.
    This cat is an excellent fisher and hunter, but a gentle companion for humans and known for high intelligence.
    The breed is not recognized by The Cat Fanciers' Association -- and nor is it in our list of cat breeds,
     like the others on this list -- but short-haired and long-haired varieties have championship status
     in The International Cat Association.</p>

  <li style= font-size:30px>Serengeti</li>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Serengetimalecat.jpg/235px-Serengetimalecat.jpg"/>
  <p style= font-size:25px;>This breed was created by crossing a Bengal cat with an Oriental Shorthair.
    The Serengeti has no wildcat blood, as the Bengals who were foundation stock
    for the breed were several generations removed from the original wildcat cross.
    Although Serengetis can be shy at first, they open up quickly and love to "help" their people.
    Like Bengals, they are very high-energy and agile, so they need plenty of exercise.
    The Serengeti has Preliminary New Breed status in TICA and isn't recognized at all by the CFA.</p>


  <li style= font-size:30px>Napoleon</li>
  <img src="http://www.kittensncats.com/uploads/1/0/6/3/10633434/7721497.jpg?262"/>
  <p style= font-size:25px;>This Napoleon has long fur and short legs, which are the hallmarks of the breed
    predecessors: a cross between a Munchkin and Persian. They are round-headed and thick-bodied cats,
    and while the round features give an air of innocence, they are just as capable of mischief
    as any other cat. They are described as gentle, affectionate, and outgoing.
    The breed has Preliminary New Breed status in TICA and is notrecognized by CFA.</p>

  <li style= font-size:30px>German Rex</li>
  <img src="http://rarecatbreeds.wyrdwul.com/BPimages/GRX/dazzie_6mnda.jpg"/>
  <p style= font-size:25px;>The German Rex gets its famous wavy coat from a mutation on the same gene as the one
    that causes the Cornish Rex's unique texture, and these cats have many of the same
    personality traits of their English cousin, as well. The breed originated as a natural
    mutation, too, and people didn't start deliberately breeding for the Rex trait until the
     late 1950s. The German Rex almost died out in 1970s, but they are experiencing a renaissance
      these days thanks to a group of breeders in Germany and other European countries.</p>




  <li style= font-size:30px>Ojos Azules</li>
  <img src="http://www.catswallpapers.net/wallpapers/ojos-azules-photo.jpg"/>
<br>
  <p style= font-size:25px;>In 1984, a family discovered a very unusual feral
    cat colony in New Mexico:Some of its members had piercing, dark-blue eyes.
    One of these cats, a tortoiseshell kitten, was bred to unrelated males, and
     all the kittens had blue eyes. TICA recognized the breed in 1991, but even
     at that time there were only 10 of these cats known to exist. Because of
     its rarity, little is known about the breed's personality, although
     these cats have been reported to be friendly and affectionate.
     The few Ojos Azules breeders are working with geneticists to see if
     the breed is even viable.</p>
